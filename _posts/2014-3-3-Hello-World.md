> ### I want to see a world with a benign AGI. 
(More like I want to learn/work 100+ hours a week and passionately trade my entire youth for what exactly again?)

> As I stood at the threshold of my new life, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing for the carefree days of my youth. But I knew that my determination to see a world with a benign artificial intelligence, one that could coexist peacefully with humanity, required sacrifice. I was prepared to trade my youth and every waking hour to work towards this goal. It was a dream worth striving for, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.
