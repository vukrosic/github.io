> As I stood at the threshold of my new life, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing for the carefree days of my youth. But I knew that my determination to see a world with a benign artificial intelligence, one that could coexist peacefully with humanity, required sacrifice. I was prepared to trade my youth and every waking hour to work towards this goal. It was a dream worth striving for, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.

## Neural Network From Scratch Using NumPy

In this post, we will learn about the math behind machine learning and use Python to build a small library for creating neural networks with various layers (such as fully connected and convolutional layers).


1. Input data is provided to the neural network. This data serves as the basis for the network's predictions or decisions.

2. The data is processed by the layers of the network, which may include fully connected, convolutional, or other types of layers. Each layer applies transformations to the data as it passes through.

3. The error is calculated based on the difference between the network's output and the desired output. This error value is used to measure the performance of the network and guide the optimization process.

4. A parameter (such as a weight or bias) is adjusted by subtracting the derivative of the error with respect to the parameter. This helps to improve the accuracy of the network by modifying the transformations applied by the layers.

5. The process is repeated, with the updated parameters being used to generate new predictions or decisions. This continues until the network's performance meets the desired level of accuracy.
